                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <p>My three-person team was given an open-ended problem. The ask involved creating an app that would help musicians collaborate through Guitar Center’s website. </p>

                <div class="large-4 columns">
                    <img src="MagicImg/MagicMindmap.png">

                <div class="large-8 columns">
                    <h4>Approach</h4>


                    <p>My team was given a brief detailing the need: Guitar Center wanted an app that would help musicians collaborate more easily together, and might eventually expand into booking gigs and other business-related ventures. We decided our MVP should center around the collaboration element, and thus Busker was born. </p>


                    <p>I was tasked with wire framing the user’s task flow, generated the secondary of our two personas, participated in the contextual inquiry, conducted three in-depth user interviews, and created the site maps and visual representation of user and musician flows. I also conducted usability testing using a clickable prototype in InVision.
                    </p>

                    <p>We discovered through interviews and observation that musicians don’t have an innate problem with collaborating in local music scenes. For professionals and hobbyists alike, they find collaboration a natural and longstanding part of playing music. We sought to give online collaboration the sense of serendipity and immediate returns in both social and professional engagement that musicians ideally find in real-life interaction.</p>

                    <p>
                        We conceptualized an app that would allow musicians to see and play music with one another, broadcast live performances, save bands or get matched with other musicians based on several criteria, tag and locate new gear through Guitar Center’s website, and interact with fans. Users not currently playing, on their part, could “tip,” or offer money for performances they enjoyed, start their own broadcasts, chat with other viewers, follow bands, and catalog their gear. Organizing these various tasks proved an interesting challenge, and it proved necessary to make decisions while closely adhering to our persona and information gathered from interviews.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="large-7 columns">
                <h4>Process</h4>

                <p>We began this project with interviews. As a non-musician, I knew I had much to gain by tapping into others’ expertise. Individually, I spoke with three professional musicians about ways in which they collaborate, and ways in which they wish that process could be easier. With this insight, we began creating personas and user flows. </p>

                <p>Our MVP didn’t begin to coalesce, though, until we had a design studio. This consisted of rapidly sketching ideas in limited timeframes of no more than a few minutes for about half an hour. Out of this effort, we emerged with the idea of online, visual jam-sessions facilitated by algorithmic matching based on user-generated profile criteria. </p>

                <p>With the idea in place, we were able to begin designing. My team worked well together, dividing wire framing tasks evenly in the following way: spectator flow, musician flow, and mobile. We also divided the remaining tasks based on individual strengths. My area falls into analytics and information architecture, and so I was in charge of site-mapping, persona image generation, and maintaining the schedule in addition to wire framing. </p>
